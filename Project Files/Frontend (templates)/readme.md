All templates use:

- 📹 Full-screen video or image backgrounds  
- 💫 Animated particle overlays (`particles.js`)  
- ✨ Smooth transitions and keyframe animations  
- 🎨 Consistent design language with green-themed accents

---

## 🌐 Technologies Used

- **HTML5 + CSS3** – semantic layout and rich styling  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – for particle animation and DOM interaction  
- **Particles.js** – lightweight animation engine for floating visuals  
- **MP4 Background** – hosted locally for smooth full-screen effects

## 🛠 How to Use

To use these templates:

1. Place them inside a Flask `templates/` directory (or adapt to any backend).  
2. Ensure corresponding static files like images, videos, and particles.js are placed correctly under `static/`.  
3. Link the correct Flask routes or your own form actions.
