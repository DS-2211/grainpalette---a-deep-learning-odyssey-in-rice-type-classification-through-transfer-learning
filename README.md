# ðŸŒ¾ GrainPalette â€“ A Deep Learning Odyssey in Rice Type Classification

A computer vision project using **Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2** to classify five rice grain typesâ€”**Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag**â€”with over 92% accuracy.  
This repo includes everything from model training and evaluation to an end-to-end web demo built with Flask.
