<!-- GrainPalette â€“ A Deepâ€‘Learning Odyssey in Rice Type Classification -->

# GrainPaletteÂ ðŸŒ¾

A fullâ€‘stack project that identifies five rice varietiesâ€”**Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, Karacadag**â€”from grainâ€‘level images.  
It couples a MobileNetâ€‘based TensorFlow model with a lightweight Flask API and a modern, animated web interface.
